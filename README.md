Throughout the site I use orange and brown shades as they are warmer colours. This is to support the meditation theme as warmer colours are more relaxing on the eyes.

	A main tab to move navigate throughout the website
 Testing:
 	I have tested the website on Opera and Google Chrome for laptop. To check for its accessibility at different screen sizes I viewed it with different browser sizes and resolutions
  I used the https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html#textarea w3 validator
 Solved Bugs:
 	Originally, I was using downloaded files for the image links and it meant that when I was trying the website on its github hosted link, none of the images were loading. I changed these to be the links to their addresses on Google.
 	The media queries were also having issues, especially with the embedded video, and after some trial and error it now works.
